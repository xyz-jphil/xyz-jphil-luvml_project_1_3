This is luvml, a java DSL. Luvml is a way to Love Html (and XML). It is a Html DSL compatible with normal Java and Javascript (using JSweet v3). Luvml can be used to generate wordpress codes also. It can be used to generate many kinds of markups. It is inspired by htmlflow, htmltags(scala.js), and something of my own. Actually the base interface ___F in luvml is equivalent to Frag in scala.js, when I wrote it, I did not even know that htmltags(scala.js) exists. So luvml is not inspired by scala.js but after writing luvml I realized htmltags(scala.js) is probably doing it better. Still luvml is required, because it is more general purpose, it is not just for html, xhtml, xml. It works for svg and i don't there is any dsl for svg, it works for css (i rarely use it for css), etc.
